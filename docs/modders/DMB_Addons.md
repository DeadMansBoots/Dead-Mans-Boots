# Addons: mods that bring code (Dead Man's Boots)

In VCMI a mod is data. Dead Man's Boots (DMB) also lets a mod bring code of two kinds: an AI
player, and a random map generator with its own lobby tab. Such a mod is packaged, listed,
installed, updated and switched on or off like any other mod. DMB itself ships no addon: without
one, the AI menus hold VCMI's own AIs and the lobby has no generator tab.

## An AI plugin

The mod carries the AI's library in a folder named `ai`, and its `mod.json` declares it:

```json
"aiPlugin" : {
    "library" : "MyAI",           // ai/MyAI.dll (Windows), ai/libMyAI.so, ai/libMyAI.dylib
    "name" : "My AI",             // what the launcher's AI menus show and the settings store
    "kinds" : [ "adventure" ],    // "adventure", "battle", or both
    "abi" : 1,                    // the AI ABI number the library was built for (DMB's AI SDK)
    "builtFor" : "0.5.0"          // the DMB version it was built against (for messages)
}
```

The library exports VCMI's usual `GetAiName`, plus `GetNewAI` (adventure) and/or `GetNewBattleAI` (battle), so an existing
VCMI AI needs little change. A C++ AI shares classes with the engine and has no stable binary interface, so DMB numbers the
interface: the AI ABI number (`lib/modding/AIAbi.h`), raised in any change to a class an AI shares with the engine and in
nothing else. Third parties build their plugins themselves, against the AI SDK that DMB publishes with each release
(`make_ai_sdk.py`: the engine's headers, the import library, the compiler and the exact library versions, and an example). An
author puts `DMB_AI_ABI_EXPORTS` once in the library's main.cpp, which writes two exports, `GetAiAbiVersion` and `GetAiBuiltFor`, and
names the same number as `abi` in the manifest.

The loader reads the number from the library itself before anything of it runs, so a manifest cannot claim another one. A library
whose number is not the game's, or that carries none, is refused with a message saying which number it was built for and which the
game has, and a game that asks for it gets VCMI's own AI instead, with the reason in the log. A manifest with an `abi` that is not the
game's is refused earlier, in the launcher's menus, with the same words. A manifest with no `abi` keeps the older rule: it loads only in
the DMB version named in `builtFor`. Once the mod is enabled, the launcher lists the AI by name in its AI menus. A plugin that cannot
load is shown greyed out, with the reason. DMB's mod catalog pins the SHA-256 of the `ai` folder; a mod not in the catalog loads only
where the player has switched on `mods.allowUnlistedCode`.

## A map generator

The mod carries everything it runs in a folder named `generator`, and brings the layout of its lobby
tab and its texts in `Content`, like any mod's resources:

```text
mymapgen/
    mod.json
    generator/                            everything that runs (the command included)
    Content/config/widgets/mygen/tab.json and its pages
    Content/config/mygen/english.json     its texts (a path of its own: not config/translations)
```

```json
"mapGenerator" : {
    "name" : "My Generator",                     // what the lobby's Random Map button says in its mode
    "command" : "generator/generate.cmd",        // inside the generator folder
    "tab" : "config/widgets/mygen/tab.json",     // the tab's layout, in the mod's Content
    "atBegin" : true                             // makes the game's map at Begin (addon API level 3)
}
```

The lobby has one Random Map button. With a generator mod enabled, its first press opens the random
map settings in the mode used last, and each press after that moves to the next mode: VCMI's own
random map ("VCMI Random") or the generator's tab, named by `name`. The button shows the mode, the
lobby remembers it (`persistentStorage.json`, `dmb.randomMapMode`), and only the host can use it.

The tab layout is an ordinary VCMI widget layout. Its pages are a `pages` widget named `pages`
(addon API level 2, [DMB_UI_Modding.md](DMB_UI_Modding.md)), or, in layouts written for level 1, a
`pages` list naming one layout per page, opened by buttons that call `activateMapGenPage`. Its
`defaults` hold the map settings (`map`), the generator's own settings (`params`) and an optional
`preset`. Widgets bind to settings with `"setting": "persistent:mapGen/params/<name>"`, which keeps
their values in `persistentStorage.json`. The callbacks `activateMapGenPage`, `resetMapGenDefaults`,
`generateMapGenMap` and `chooseMapGenTemplate` are the tab's own, and from level 3
`chooseMapGenTeams` (VCMI's team grid, stored as `map/teams`, a team number per player in colour
order; the grid's layout comes with the VCMI Extras mod, and without it the player is told so) and
`chooseMapGenCustomSize` (VCMI's custom size window, stored as `map/width` and
`map/height`; picking a size bound to `map/size` afterwards replaces it), and `saveMapGenPreset` and
`loadMapGenPreset` (the player's own saved settings, a JSON file each in the user folder's
`MapGenPresets/<mod id>`, named as the player types; loading one puts it in place of the tab's
settings). The template chooser lists none, Random (stored as `random`) and every template
installed. The texts the tab itself shows can
be reworded by the mod's translation: `vcmi.mapGen.generate.hover`, `.running`, `.failed`,
`.refused` (two `%s`: the generator's name, then the reason), `.humans` (one `%d`: the players in
the lobby), `.atBegin`, `vcmi.mapGen.template.hover`, `.choose`, `.none`, `.random`,
`vcmi.mapGen.teams.missing`, and `vcmi.mapGen.presets.saveTitle`, `.saved`, `.failed` (one `%s`
each: the name), `.loadTitle`, `.loadHelp`, `.loaded` (one `%s`), `.none`. Where the mod brings
none, DMB's generic wording shows (`vcmi.dmb.mapGenerator.*`).

The command gets these arguments, and writes a `.vmap` at `--out`:

```text
--w N --h N --players N --humans N --seed N --out PATH
--underground 1          (a two-level map)
--declaremods 1|0
--vcmiroot DIR --vcmiuserdir DIR     (the game's data folder and the player's user folder)
--template NAME          (a template the player chose; the chooser lists every template installed)
--preset NAME
--bio.<name> VALUE       (each stored setting; rivers as --rivers VALUE)
```

Its output goes to `extmapgen_log.txt` in the logs folder. When it fails, a line there that starts
with `Error:` is what the player is shown. The generator must write nothing inside its own folder
(caches belong under `--vcmiuserdir`), because DMB checks that folder before every run, as below.
It runs with no console window, so a console program shows nothing on the player's screen. With
several generator mods enabled, the last one in load order gets the tab. Every map it makes stays
in the player's `Maps/RandomMaps`, which the scenario list shows as a folder like any other, so a
map can be played again. (VCMI's own "save random maps" setting covers only VCMI's generator.)

### A generator that makes the map at Begin (`atBegin`, API level 3)

The map is made when the host presses Begin, after every player has picked a town, where VCMI's own
random map is made: on the host's server, as the game starts. The tab needs no Generate button (a
leftover one only tells the player that the map is made at Begin). While the generator's mode is
on, the lobby's random map is the generator's, with player slots from the tab's settings:

- `map/size`, or `map/width` and `map/height` when both are set;
- `map/underground`;
- `map/humans`: the slots a human or the computer may take (-1 for Random), at least one per player
  in the lobby;
- `params/compOnly`: the slots only the computer takes (-1 for Random); a layout without it counts
  the rest of `map/players` as the computer's. At Begin the generator gets the game's count as
  `--bio.compOnly`, whatever the tab stored;
- `map/teams`: a team number per player, in colour order (-1 for none).

At Begin the command gets the arguments above, with `--players` and `--humans` counting the game's
players and those a human may take, plus:

```text
--factions core:castle,random,...     each player's town, in colour order
--bio.compOnly N                      the players only the computer takes
--teams red,blue;tan,green            the teams of two or more, when there are any
```

The game's players are always the first colours (red, blue, tan and on), which is where the
generator places its players, so `--factions` lists their towns by position: the faction as map
files name it (`core:castle`, or a mod's `modid:faction`), or `random` for the generator to pick.
A player count the tab leaves on Random (-1) is rolled when the lobby's random map is put together,
so the lobby shows the players the game will have.

A generator can take the colours the players chose instead, as VCMI's own random map does, keeping a
Random count a surprise until Begin. It lists the argument in its mod.json:

```json
"mapGenerator" : { ..., "arguments" : [ "humanColors" ] }
```

Then the lobby offers every colour's slot, a count left on Random reaches the command as -1 for it to
roll (`--players`, `--humans`, `--bio.compOnly`), and it gets:

```text
--humanColors red,green               the colours the seated humans took, in colour order
```

Those are the map's seats for humans or the computer; its other players take the first colours left,
for the computer only. `--factions` then has an entry for each colour from red, by colour: the third
is tan's town, whether or not tan plays. A command that does not list an argument never gets it, as
a command refuses arguments it does not know.

While it works, a generator can tell the players what it is doing. Each stage it enters, it writes
a line to its output:

```text
[phase] <n>/<total> <id>
```

with `n` counting from 1 up to `total`, and `id` a word naming the stage. The load screen's bar
moves to that stage, and above it every player sees the mod's text `vcmi.mapGen.phase.<id>` in the
host's language, guests without the mod included. A stage without a text moves the bar and shows
nothing. OmniMapGen writes 23 stages, "Sculpting Erathia" among them.

The tab's settings travel to the server inside the game's options, since the server can run in a
process of its own. A player who left their town on Random gets the town the map's header names for
them. When the generator fails, every player is told "Failed to load game" with its `Error:` line,
and the lobby stays open. A big map may take a few minutes; a generator still running after ten is
ended.

### A generator that makes maps to pick (without `atBegin`)

The tab's `generateMapGenMap` button runs the command with the arguments above, and the new map is
selected in the scenario list. When more players are in the lobby than the tab's human players
setting (friends who joined, or hotseat names), `--humans` is raised to one per player, and
`--players` with it if needed: a map with fewer human slots cannot be played there, and a
multiplayer lobby does not list it. Towns are picked after the map is made, so such a generator
cannot place them.

### Multiplayer

The players who join need neither the generator nor its mod, as long as the mod changes no game
content (a generator, templates and texts do not): when the game starts, the host's server sends
every player the whole game, the generated map included. Content the map uses from other mods, such
as their towns, needs those mods on every side, as in any VCMI game.

## Trust: DMB's mod catalog pins the code

A mod's code runs with the player's rights, so DMB runs it only when
[DMB's mod catalog](https://github.com/DeadMansBoots/DMB-Mods-Repository) vouches for that exact
code. The catalog entry of an addon carries `codeSha256`, the pin of its `ai` or `generator` folder:

- every file in the folder becomes a line `<its SHA-256>  <its path>`, the path relative to the
  folder with `/` separators;
- the lines are sorted by path, each ends in a newline, and the SHA-256 of all of them is the pin.

`python tools/addon_hash.py --zip mymod.zip` in the catalog's repository prints it. The launcher saves
the catalog's pins whenever it downloads the catalog. Before an AI plugin loads and before each
generator run, the game hashes the folder and compares. A mod the catalog does not list, or whose
files differ from the pinned ones, is refused, and the player is told why.

A build handed to a tester before the catalog lists it runs on that tester's PC once its pin is in
the user config folder's `dmbTestedCode.json`, in the same form as the catalog's (`{ "mod-id":
["<pin>"] }`). The launcher never writes that file, and a build approved there is still refused if
its files change afterwards.

While you build and test your own addon, switch the check off in your `settings.json`:

```json
"mods" : { "allowUnlistedCode" : true }
```

Players never need this: a mod installed from the launcher's list is pinned.

## Getting listed

Publish the mod's zip and its `mod.json` wherever you host your project, then open a pull request on
the catalog that adds `entries/<mod-id>.json` with the download, the size, and `codeSha256`. The
pull request's check downloads the zip and verifies the pin.
