/// DMB: the game's own fonts for the launcher (the project owner, September 27th: "we need to get the font from
/// in-game heroes, and increase the font size...we want to match in-game heroes aesthetic exactly").
/// Heroes III draws its text from bitmap fonts in its data files (Data\MEDFONT.FNT and the like),
/// which Qt cannot load, so the launcher makes a TrueType font of one from the player's own files as
/// it starts: every pixel of the game's glyphs a square, so the font draws the game's pixels exactly
/// at the font's own height. DMB ships none of the game's art.
