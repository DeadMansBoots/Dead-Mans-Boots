/// DMB: the launcher's look (K, September 26th), the setting launcher.theme:
///  - "leather": the leather Heroes III fills its windows with, read from the player's own game files
///    (DIBOXBCK; DMB ships no game art), gold buttons with black text and gold lettering, the game's
///    own look. Before any game files are imported there is no leather to read, and "dark" is used.
///  - "dark": black and dark grey with the same gold accents.
///  - "system": the platform's own look, as stock VCMI's launcher has it.
/// Applied after the game's filesystem is loaded and before the main window builds its widgets, and again
/// whenever the Settings page's Launcher Look changes; every window and dialog of the launcher follows.
namespace LauncherTheme

	/// The look's four colour slots (K, October 1st: "everything is configurable now ... One color per slot"): the
	/// window's background, the partitions (frames, tabs, side menu, titles), the primary buttons and the secondary
	/// buttons (the Settings page's switches). Each takes "default" (the slot's own in the game's leather look: leather,
	/// gold, gold, blue), one of the game's eight hero colours (read from its own player colours), silver or black.
	/// The look gives each slot a starting colour (the dark look: silver edges and buttons, red switches); the
	/// player's own choice is settings launcher.look.<slot>, which replaces it.

	/// the least a button can be and still carve `text` in gold-button lettering; 0 if there is
	/// nothing to carve it with yet (the language is not English, a letter is missing, or nothing has
	/// been harvested). For a row of buttons laid out to one shared width before any look is chosen
	/// (CSettingsView's category bar): reserve this now, rather than fight a layout already computed
	/// to Qt's own narrower default once carving turns on.

	/// `button`'s text, for a button the look may carve. A carved button shows its word as its icon and keeps its
	/// text empty; a plain setText puts the plain text back beside the carving (K, September 29th, the Settings
	/// page's category buttons: "as soon as you hit a button, the buttons all get wider, and the system font
	/// text comes back"). Here it stays carved, the word replaced if it changed; a button that is not carved
	/// takes the text as setText does.
	void setButtonText(QPushButton * button, const QString & text);

	/// `button`'s icon replaced with a crop of the game's own main-menu button art (SPRITES/<defName>,
	/// its lit frame), for a sidebar icon that matches Heroes' own identity instead of a generic Qt
	/// stock icon (Gemini's launcher feedback, K, September 28th: the puzzle-piece/wrench/question-mark
	/// icons clash with the fantasy look). Left alone (keeping whatever icon MainWindow's own .ui gave
	/// it) when there is nothing to read yet: DMB ships no game art of its own, so a player who has not
	/// imported their files sees the same stock icon as before, same fallback leather/dark already use.
	/// The button's own baked-in word sits at (holeX, holeY, holeW, holeH); it is inpainted out rather
	/// than cropped around, so the icon keeps the whole image (K's standing rule for this, same day).
