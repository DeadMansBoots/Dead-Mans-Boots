/// DMB: an AI plugin is a mod that carries an AI library. Its mod.json declares it:
///     "aiPlugin" : { "library" : "OmniAI", "name" : "OmniAI", "kinds" : [ "adventure" ], "builtFor" : "0.1.0" }
/// and the library sits in the mod's own "ai" folder (ai/OmniAI.dll, ai/libOmniAI.so, ai/libOmniAI.dylib),
/// exporting VCMI's usual GetAiName plus GetNewAI and/or GetNewBattleAI. A C++ AI shares classes with
/// the engine and has no stable binary interface, so a plugin loads only in the DMB version it was
/// built for, and only when DMB's mod catalog pins its "ai" folder (AddonCode.h).
