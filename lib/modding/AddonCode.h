/// DMB: the code an addon mod brings (an AI plugin's "ai" folder, a map generator's "generator" folder)
/// runs only when DMB's mod catalog vouches for it (K, September 26th). A catalog entry pins its mod's
/// code with "codeSha256", one hash or a list of them; the launcher saves the pins of the default
/// catalog (the one DMB ships with), and the game checks the folder against them before it runs
/// anything from it. A tester's PC may also hold builds approved there before the catalog lists them
/// (testedPinsFile), each by its exact hash. The setting mods.allowUnlistedCode lets developers run
/// code they built themselves.
